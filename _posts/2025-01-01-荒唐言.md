I often feel like a leaf that has fallen by chance to the ground, unable to be simply defined. Traditional, stubborn, fragmented, and occasionally haunted by paranoid thoughts—perhaps these words capture some fragmented traits of mine, but they never quite fit perfectly. I can never seem to give myself a clear label. Maybe that's why I've slowly learned to accept that I am simply a grain of sand in the vast sea of humanity—ordinary, humble, and inconspicuous.

My interests and hobbies don't always carry grand or unique aspirations.

My passion for fitness seems more like a form of spiritual cultivation. In the gym, I sweat silently, not quite the person I was when I once weighed close to 200 pounds. The changes in my body have taught me the meaning of "fat-packed muscles." I no longer emphasize an ideal physique but instead savor the process of refining and mastering my body. It’s a form of focus, a challenge against myself. Occasionally I wear headphones, occasionally I don’t, losing myself in my own rhythm. I prefer to call it "training" rather than just "fitness," for it is a form of inner discipline.

I love reading. Though I haven’t read enough, I always carry a thirst for words, hoping to find some kind of answer between the lines. I often turn the pages of *The Road to Happiness* and *The Courage to Be Disliked*. Each reading is a spiritual cleansing, as though I find a resonance with my soul in the pages.

In addition to reading, I am also learning to run. Like fitness, it’s not just a physical exercise but a way to empty my mind. When I run, I maintain a unique distance from the world, entering a state of selflessness. It has become an outlet for my soul, replacing the basketball games I once loved. As Haruki Murakami wrote in *What I Talk About When I Talk About Running*, running is a way to think independently, a conversation with oneself.

I also enjoy hiking up small mountains or spending time in the park, quietly observing my surroundings and feeling the breath of nature. In the mountains and waters, I find an unspoken tranquility, an effortless serenity, which may be the most precious moments in life.

At one point, I engaged in research for a while. In the beginning, I felt it wasn’t a path for me. However, over time, I realized that this experience allowed me to more clearly see my own shortcomings. Whether it was escaping from challenges or being timid in the face of difficulty, all of these have become part of my growth. To establish oneself, to cultivate life, rather than waiting for some outcome, it’s better to ground oneself and do things well.

Sometimes, I recall a quote that once resonated deeply with me: "There is only one heroism in the world：to see the world as it is and to love it." I believe this is what I am striving for now—no matter how plain life may be, still loving every moment of it.
